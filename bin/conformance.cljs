  No JVM anywhere: `kotoba.sema`, `kotoba.kir`, `provider.dataspace` and the
  reference runtime are all `.cljc` and run under nbb, so the whole
  analyze -> lower -> instantiate -> invoke path is Node.

  The classpath is the sibling west checkouts -- this repository sits at
  `orgs/kotoba-lang/oak` in the com-junkawasaki superproject, so its
  dependencies are at `../<repo>/src`. Set OAK_CLASSPATH to override.

  A dependency that is not checked out is REPORTED and the run exits 2 --
  neither 0 nor 1. A suite that could not run must not answer with the value a
  suite that ran and found nothing answers with."
